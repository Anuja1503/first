        A blog (a truncation of "weblog") is a discussion 
        or informational website published on the 
        World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often 
        informal diary-style text entries (posts). 
        Posts are typically displayed in reverse 
        chronological order, so that the most recent 
        post appears first, at the top of the web page.

        My name is Scott Chow, and I am going to show you how to 
        start blogging today. I have been building
        blogs and websites since 2002. In that time 
        I have launched several of my own blogs, and
        helped hundreds of others do the same.
